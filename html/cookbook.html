        <h2>Cheese Pizza Recipe</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (about 110°F)</li>
            <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional)</li>
            <li>Olive oil for brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the warm water, yeast, and sugar. Stir gently and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and 2 cups of flour to the yeast mixture. Stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Gradually add more flour, about 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough comes together and is no longer sticky. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, then remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C) and place a pizza stone or baking sheet inside to heat.</li>
            <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into 2 equal pieces. On a floured surface, roll out one piece of dough into a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li>If using a pizza stone, transfer the rolled dough onto a pizza peel dusted with flour or cornmeal. If using a baking sheet, place the dough directly on the sheet.</li>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of the prepared tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce, then sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone (or place the baking sheet in the oven). Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Brush the crust with a little olive oil for extra flavor. If desired, top with fresh basil leaves before slicing and serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your homemade cheese pizza!</p>
